🎯 Project Objectives

    Build a basic wireless LAN (WLAN) using a wireless router.

    Connect multiple devices, such as:

        Desktop PCs

        Laptops

        Tablets / Mobile devices

        Network Printers (optional)

    Configure:

        IP addressing

        Wireless router settings (SSID, password, security mode)

        Wired & wireless connectivity

    Verify communication using tools like ping.

🏗️ Network Components


Depending on the topology inside your .pkt file, the network typically includes:

    Wireless Router (e.g., Linksys / WRT series)

    Switch (optional)

    Wired PCs connected via Ethernet

    Wireless devices connected via Wi-Fi

    Printer (optional)

⚙️ Configuration Overview

    Wireless Router Setup

        Configure the SSID

        Set the security mode (e.g., WPA2-PSK)

        Create a Wi-Fi password

        Configure DHCP (enabled/disabled as needed)

    Device Configuration

        Assign static IPs or use DHCP

        Connect wireless devices to the configured SSID

        Connect wired devices through the switch (if available)

    Connectivity Testing

        Use ping to test communication between devices

        Ensure Wi-Fi clients can reach wired devices and vice-versa

🧪 Testing & Validation

    Verify IP addressing

    Test wireless authentication

    Confirm devices can communicate across the network

    Ensure the wireless router provides proper routing and DHCP (if enabled)
